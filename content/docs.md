## What is HAWA-ON?
HAWA-ON is a weather platform which provides latest weather data for all the major airports across India. Our services can be used by meterologists, scientists, pilots and many others. We render this weather data in the form of tables and maps which would allow anyone using the site to gain an instant knowledge of weather across the airports of India.    

## Our Services
1. Table-view    
The **Table-view** page provides a tabular representation of latest weather data. Each entry in the table follows a `color key`.
![Color-key](https://github.com/onapte/test/blob/main/content/color-key.png)  
As shown, the `color key` consists of 4 entries. The red entry corresponds to weather unsafe for flying, the yellow entry corresponds to weather to be careful for flying, the green entry corresponds to weather safe for flying and the blue entry corresponds to no information about the weather.  

2. Map-view    
The **Map-view** page converts the tabular entries in the **Table-view** to markers inside a map. The markers follow the same `color key` as stated above. The map is scrollable with dynamic mouse interaction. Hovering on any part on the map will show up the name of that place. In addition, clicking or hovering on any marker on the map will display the name of the place the marker is pointing to.

3. Satellite Images
The **Satellite** page shows the latest Satellite images of India - Infrared and Water vapour. Please note that these images are a copyright of the Ministry of Earth Sciences and are for quick reference only.

4. Radars
We also provide a dedicated page for **Radars** of India. This page contains a number of buttons. Clicking on any of these buttons will show up the radar of the city shown by the respective button.
